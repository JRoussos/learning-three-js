# Learning 3D Animations 

<br>

### What is this?

Some time ago I saw an example of a website using the webGL library, I was captivated.

I was extremely intersted in learning this new thing and so I started researching it.

I read about GLSL, Three.js and Shaders and now that I have a basic understanding of the concept, It's time to start practicing.

<strong> This is a collection of cool ideas and stuff I wanted to try and learn as far as 3D web design goes. </strong>

### What I use

I decided to use the [Three.js library](https://threejs.org/) and more specificaly the [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) which is a React renderer for Three.js.

It has a lot of great helpers with the included library of [drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei) and it can save you a lot of boilerplate.

### What I have so far

- Fake 3D effect on mouse move with the use of depth map. Similar to what Facebook is doing.

- RGB shift on mouse move. When the cursor passes over the image it splits its color channels (Red, Green and Blue) depending the mouse acceleration. 

- More are coming...
